- Decision science module working on a real case
- Machine Learning : Scikit-learn - supervised and unsupervised learning
- Deep Learning : Tensorflow and Keras - RNN, CNN, NLP
- Data Engineering : Google Cloud Platform, Docker, ML Flow, Heroku, Streamlit
- Final project : Care for Health ([have a look at my repository!](https://github.com/AlbanKv/care_for_health))
